System programmers need a system programming language that
detects or prevents common programming errors involving pointers. This
will improve the reliability and security of system software and
the productivity of system programmers. This technical report describes
Checked C, an extended version of C that provides bounds-checking for
pointers and arrays.

\parbox{5in}{
Checked C adds new pointer types and array types that are
bounds-checked, yet layout-compatible with existing pointer and array
types. In keeping with the low-level nature of C, 
programmers control the placement of bounds information in data
structures and the flow of bounds information through programs. Static
checking enforces the integrity of the bounds information and allows the
eliding of some dynamic checking. Dynamic checking enforces the
integrity of memory accesses at runtime when static checking cannot.
Checked C is backwards-compatible: existing C programs work
``as is''. Programmers incrementally opt-in to bounds checking, while
maintaining binary compatibility. Checked C builds on extensions to C
proposed by the CCured and Deputy projects.
