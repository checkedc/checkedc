There are large amounts of existing critical infrastructure and
systems software written in C. This software is prone to
low-level programming errors that lead to security vulnerabilities,
correctness issues, and reliability problems.  This specification describes
Checked C, an extension to C designed to help improve the security and 
reliability of existing C code.

\parbox{6.0in}{Checked C provides backwards-compatibility.
It adds opt-in features for eliminating classes of errors that
cause memory corruption, improved type-safety, and  statically verifiable
assertions.
These features build on each other: avoiding memory corruption
is needed for type-safety, and type-safety makes it easier
to check properties of C programs.
Checked C provides an alternative to rewriting existing C code in another
language, which may be too costly or impractical.}

\vspace{11pt}

\parbox{6.0in}{Checked C adds new pointer types and array types
with null-checking and bounds-checking.  
The pointer types
are layout-compatible with existing pointer
types, making Checked C code binary-compatible with existing C code.
Pointer bounds are described using annotations on variable declarations.
Bounds are checked at runtime before memory accesses.
Compiler optimizations eliminate unnecessary runtime bounds checking.
Static checking ensures the correctness of the bounds annotations.}

\vspace{11pt}

\parbox{6.0in}{Checked C also adds checked scopes. Checked scopes
provide guarantees about the bounds-safety and type-safety of code
in them. In checked
scopes, only new bounds-checked and null-checked pointer types
can be used.  Type casts are also restricted to ensure type
safety.  Casts between void pointers and pointers to
 data that contains pointers are not allowed.}

\vspace{11pt}

\parbox{6.0in}{Checked C adds generic functions and structures
and existential types. This lets many uses of void pointers be replaced
with type-safe code. Generic type variables are treated as incomplete
types and only single copies of functions are needed.}
