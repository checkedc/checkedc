\chapter{Random Fragments}

Here are some fragments of ideas that need to be more fully developed.

\section{Definite initialization}

We require initializers for variables that have checked pointer types that may
be used to access memory.  We also require initializers for variables that have members
or elements that have checked pointers and that may be used to access memory.
We want to relax this requirement so that fewer program changes are needed when 
porting legacy code to Checked C.  We plan to allow delayed initialization by adding a
{\em definite initialization} analysis
similar to those for C\# or Java for variables or members with checked pointer types.
In programs for those languages, a variable may be declared without an initialization value, as
long is it is definitely initialized before it may be used.  A dataflow analysis prescribed by the
language definition is used to determine when a variable is definitely initialized.

\section{Opaque types}

Pointers to void are sometimes used as handles that hide details of API implementations.  An
API may provide a handle that is typed as \uncheckedptrvoid\ for 
users of the API, with the API implementation using a pointer to an actual
type.

Opaque types: these allow different kinds of handles to be distinguished.
They are incomplete types with enough information to represent
the types, but nothing else.  They can be copied around and used, but the internal
details remain unknown in the scope of the declaration.  No conversions to and 
from opaque types are allowed.

\section{Opaque types}

We extend \keyword{typedef} declarations so that they can also declare opaque types. 
The \keyword{typedef} is followed by the new keyword \keyword{opaque}.
This creates a new named type that is distinct from all other types during
typechecking and that uses the specified type as its runtime representation.
Importantly, the new named type is not the same as the specified type.  This allows
handle types to be distinguished during typechecking:
\begin{lstlisting}
typedef opaque void *ProcessHandle;
typedef opaque void *FileHandle;
\end{lstlisting}
An attempt to use a \lstinline+ProcessHandle+ where a \lstinline+FileHandle+ 
is expected will result in a typechecking error.

To implement operations on an opaque type,
programmers reveal the actual implementation type of the opaque type
in some scopes of the program.  The
keyword \keyword{typedef} is followed by the new keyword \keyword{reveal}:
\begin{lstlisting}
typedef reveal _Ptr<struct ProcessData> ProcessHandle;
typedef reveal _Ptr<struct FileData> FileHandle;
\end{lstlisting}
In the scope of a \keyword{reveal} declaration, casts between the
opaque type and the implementation type are allowed.  
Converting the implementation type to the representation
type and back to the implementation type must not lose information.  
The rules for conversions in the C specification are followed.   Note that 
this allows the representation type to be larger (in terms of bits) than the implementation type.

C-style casts between opaque types and other types are otherwise not allowed.
In the special case where a programmer must convert an opaque type to another
type (for example, a \uncheckedptrvoid{} is being stored as an integer in an existing
program), the special operator \lstinline|opaque_cast| is provided.

It is implementation-defined whether a pointer to a function type with a
parameter or return type that is an implementation type can be converted
explicitly to a pointer to a function type where the corresponding type
is the opaque type.   The calling convention must be the same for
the implementation and representation type.  If the representation type is \uncheckedptrvoid{}
and the implementation type is also a pointer type,  these conversions would be
allowed in C implementations where all pointer types have the same calling convention.



\section{Undefined behavior in C11 of misaligned pointer casts}

Pointer casts that produce incorrectly aligned pointers have undefined
behavior, according to the C11 standard. This hole should be filled in
for checked pointer types. For checked pointer types, we should specify
either (1) dereferencing an incorrectly aligned pointer shall cause a
runtime error or (2) the cast itself shall check any alignment
requirements. For case 1, note that pointer arithmetic for checked pointer types
is already
defined to preserve misalignment. 

\section{Concrete syntax for function post-conditions}
 
The current syntax for describing post-conditions places a \keyword{where}
clause after the function parameter list declaration:

\begin{lstlisting}
f( ...)
where cond1 ...
\end{lstlisting}

This syntax might lead to confusion. We might want to adopt an alternate
syntax that makes this clearer. Some suggestions are the keywords
\keyword{on_return} or \keyword{after}:

\begin{lstlisting}
f(...)
on_return cond1 ...

f(...)
after cond1 ...
\end{lstlisting}

section{Further out work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow conditional bounds expressions.   While conditional
expressions are allowed in the non-modifying expressions in a bounds expression, 
there is not a conditional form of bounds expressions.  This is useful for
specifying that an expression only has bounds if some condition is true.
This could be provided by adding a clause to bounds-exp that uses the
same syntax as C conditional expressions:
\begin{tabbing}
\var{bounds}\=\var{-exp:} \\
\>\var{non-modifying-exp} \code{?} \var{bounds-exp} \code{:} \var{bounds-exp}
\end{tabbing}

We would need to add descriptions of introduction and elimination
forms, as well as enhance the rules for checking the validity of bounds.

\item Allow bounds declarations to declare bounds for expressions.
This would allow the system to easily support tagged null pointers.
The bounds for the untagged pointer would be described. 
A tagged pointer could not be used to access memory.  It would have to be
untagged first  to have valid bounds.

\item Consider whether to allow functions to be
parametric with respect to the state of member bounds. This might be
useful to describe a function that sets one of the members of a
structure type and does not affect the state of other members.

\item We could allow signed integer expressions to be invertible
by trying to prove that the expressions are in range, using the
checking of facts in \keyword{where} clauses.
\end{itemize}



\section{Discussion of optimizing bounds check and overflow}

We had the following discussion in Section~{section:bounds-checking-at-indirections}
that distracted from the
main point of the section. It's also confusing the overflow check for x
+ c is omitted. The point of the example below is that we can make code
efficient. That deserves a fuller discussion and should be buttressed by
empirical data.

Consider as an example, z = *(x+5); where x : bounds(x, x + c). The
compiler will produce code of the form

\begin{lstlisting}
assert(x != null);
t1 = x + 5;
check x + 5 for overflow
assert(t1 != null && x <= t1 && t1 < x + c);
z = *t1;
\end{lstlisting}

This simplifies to:

\begin{lstlisting}
assert(x != null);
t1 = x + 5;
check for overflow x + 5
assert(x <= t1 && t1 < x+c);
z = *t1;
\end{lstlisting}

The compiler can recognize that \texttt{x <= t1} is always true,
leading to:-

\begin{lstlisting}
assert(x != null);
t1 = x + 5;
check for overflow of x + 5
assert(t1 < x + c);
z = *t1;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Incompleteness of static checking}

The invariant checking algorithm is not complete, in that there may be
invariants about the program that are true, but which the invariant
checker does not report as true. First, the invariant checker only uses
declared invariants. An invariant may be true after a particular
statement, but if it is not declared, the invariant checker may not be
able to use it for subsequent statements. If a programmer declares an
invariant x \textless{} y but neglects to declare the invariant y
\textless{} z, the checker will not be able to reason several statements
later that x \textless{} z, even though it may be true about the
program. This is a consequence of the compiler being a checker, not a
theorem prover. Second, the underlying logic used by the checker is not
complete: the invariants require first-order Presburger arithmetic,
complete with disjunction (or) because of the presence of min and max.
The logic used by the checker does not include axioms for disjunction or
min/max.

\section{Partial correctness}

We are pursuing a strategy of being able to prove partial correctness
when these undefined behaviors are possible. Specifically, we would
assume that some undefined behaviors do not occur in some parts of code.
We would be able to prove given this assumption that other undefined
behaviors do not occur in other parts of the program. For example, we
might assume memory allocation and type casts are in fact correct. We
might also assume that unchecked code never reads or writes through
out-of-bounds pointers. We would then be able to provide that checked code
is guaranteed to never read or write through out-of-bounds pointers.

To arrive at more complete correctness guarantees about systems, we will
use the approaches of narrowing the amount of code about which
assumptions have to be made and narrowing the types of assumptions that
have to be made (that type casts are correct and memory allocation is
correct). For example, we will narrow the amount of unchecked code so that
assumptions are needed about less and less code.

\section{Discussion of facts involving members}

\var{fact: }

\begin{quote}
\var{bounds}

\var{var-member-path relop range-exp}

\var{range-exp relop var-member-path}
\end{quote}

\section{Loop invariants and dataflow-sensitive bounds declarations}

\texttt{Array\_ptr} variables with dataflow-sensitive bounds declarations also
need loop invariants if the variables are updated in a loop. Those
invariants must be declared before the loop and cannot occur cannot
occur only within the loop, unless the loop is completely unreachable
from the beginning of the function, in which case it is dead code.

To understand why, suppose the bounds declaration only occurs in the
loop body at or after the read of a variable. There will be a path from
the beginning of the function to the read of the variable. From
condition 2 of consistency, that path must also have a bounds
declaration, which is a contradiction.
